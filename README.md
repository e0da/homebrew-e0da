# Homebrew Tap by e0da

A Homebrew tap providing additional formulae.

## Available Formulae

### plocate

A much faster `locate` command based on posting lists. plocate is a complete replacement for mlocate with a much faster (and smaller) index. It uses an inverted index over trigrams to rapidly narrow down search results instead of linearly scanning through every entry.

**Installation:**

```bash
brew install e0da/e0da/plocate
```
